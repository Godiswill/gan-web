## üí° FAQ
### Why is the first processing slow?
On the first run, the necessary data (~80MB) will be fetched and stored in the browser cache. Subsequent processing will be much faster.

### Why can't my mobile device run this?
Because running AI models in a browser requires significant memory, and mobile devices often have performance limitations that restrict the browser's available memory, causing the model to fail. For the best experience, we recommend using a desktop computer with better performance.

### Why does the effect look worse on mobile than on desktop?
To ensure smooth performance on mobile devices, a smaller and lighter model is used, which may produce less accurate results compared to desktop.
For the best experience, please use a desktop computer.

### Is there a limit to the number of images I can process in batch?
While batch processing is supported, uploading too many large images at once may cause memory issues. On mobile devices, a high-memory device is strongly recommended.

### What image formats are supported?
We support common image formats including JPG, PNG, WEBP, and AVIF.

### Is there an image size limit?
For optimal performance and browser stability, we recommend images under 10MB. Larger images may still work but could affect processing speed.
